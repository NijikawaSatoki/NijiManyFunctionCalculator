# Niji's Many Function Calculator

Note: This will not have build instructions.
Please see the project's `README.md` for those instructions.

While this is yet another calculator, it has plenty of functionality.
It is a CLI application, so a terminal shell such as `cmd.exe` (Windows) or your distro's terminal (Linux) is required.

This will attempt to aid in the comprehension of the program's functionality.

## The Main Prompt

```
		"Niji's Many Function Calculator"
	Made by Satoki Nijikawa and Wamo, of Niji System

Please state the operation that you wish to perform.
Currently implemented:
addition	subtraction	multiplication	division	modulus
exponent	cosine		sine		tangent		square-root
cube-root	square		cube
'exit' closes the program.
Which will it be? (Please enter your selection entirely in lowercase): 
```

This appears when you start the program.
The title and author are on the first two lines.

Next is the list of the currently implemented operations.
These are listed in order of implementation.

To choose an operation to perform, enter your selection at the prompt.
'square-root' and 'cube-root' can alternatively be selected via writing them as one word, `squareroot` and `cuberoot`, respectively.

`addition`: When you want to do addition. \
`subtraction`: When you want to do subtraction. \
`multiplication`: When you want to do multiplication. \
`division`: When you want to do division.
Also great for convert fractions to decimals. \
`modulus`: Like division, but for when you want the remainder. \
`exponent`: When you want to raise a number *x* to the nth power. \
`cosine`: When you want to get the cosine of an angle θ. \
`sine`: When you want to get the sine of an angle θ.
`tangent`: When you want to get the tangent of an angle θ. \
`square-root`: When you want to take the square root of a number. \
`cube-root`: When you want to take the cube root of a number. \
`square`: When you want to raise a number *x* to the power of 2.
`cube`: When you want to raise a number *x* to the power of 3.
